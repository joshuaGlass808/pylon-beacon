**One binary. No open ports. Full node vitals.**

pylon-beacon is a tiny monitoring agent for [PylonMon](https://pylonmon.com).
It **pushes** your machine's vitals out — CPU, memory, per-mount disk,
temperature, load, uptime, plus anything you add — so it works behind NAT,
CGNAT, and firewalls, on any box that can make an outbound HTTPS request.
Nothing scrapes you. Nothing listens. If the box goes silent, you get paged:
**the silence is the signal.**

- Single static binary (Go, standard library only — zero dependencies)
- Linux + Windows
- Auto-creates its own monitor in PylonMon on first push — no clicking
- Extensible: add your own metrics with one config line each

## Install

**Linux** — installs `/usr/local/bin/pylon-beacon`, writes
`/etc/pylon-beacon.conf`, and registers a systemd unit:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://pylonmon.com/beacon.sh | sh
```

**Windows** — PowerShell as Administrator; installs to
`C:\Program Files\pylon-beacon` and registers a SYSTEM scheduled task that
starts at boot and auto-restarts:

```powershell
irm https://pylonmon.com/beacon.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers prompt for your API key (or read `PYLON_KEY` if set).

**From source** (any platform with Go):

```sh
go build -o pylon-beacon .
```

## The API key

Create an **🗼 ingest-scoped** key in PylonMon:
**Settings → Admin → Status page & API → + New key → scope "ingest"**.

Ingest keys can push check-ins and metrics and do **nothing else** — they
can't read your monitors, touch incidents, or change any settings. That makes
one key safe to distribute to every box you own.

## Configuration

Config lives at `/etc/pylon-beacon.conf` (Linux) or
`C:\Program Files\pylon-beacon\beacon.conf` (Windows). Full reference:

```ini
# ---- required ----
key      = pm_xxxxxxxxxxxx        # your ingest-scoped PylonMon API key

# ---- optional ----
url      = https://pylonmon.com   # your PylonMon instance
node     = db01                   # monitor name; defaults to this hostname
interval = 20                     # seconds between pushes (default 20, min 15)

# ---- extend what it collects ----
# Each entry under [custom] runs on every push. The FIRST NUMBER found in the
# command's output becomes the metric value, reported under the entry's name.
[custom]
gpu_temp_c    = nvidia-smi --query-gpu=temperature.gpu --format=csv,noheader
queue_depth   = redis-cli llen jobs
zpool_errors  = sh -c "zpool status -x | grep -c 'DEGRADED\|FAULTED'"
battery_pct   = powershell -c "(Get-CimInstance Win32_Battery).EstimatedChargeRemaining"
# is the LOCAL site up? 1/0 — pair with a vital rule `site_up < 1`
site_up       = sh -c "curl -sf http://localhost/ >/dev/null && echo 1 || echo 0"
```

**Monitoring a web server?** For *public* up/down, a normal off-site PylonMon
HTTP monitor is the better tool — it sees what your visitors see. Use the
`site_up` recipe above for a *local* check the outside world can't do (is the
app answering on localhost even when the public route is broken?), then set a
vital rule `site_up < 1` on the node monitor.

Notes on `[custom]`:

- Commands run as the service user, with the agent's environment.
- Anything printable-as-a-number works: shell one-liners, scripts, CLIs.
- A failing command just skips that metric for the push — it never blocks
  the heartbeat.
- Name metrics with units in the suffix (`_pct`, `_c`, `_s`) and PylonMon
  formats them accordingly.

## Watching network gear: `[snmp]`

Switches, firewalls, APs, NAS boxes, PDUs and printers rarely run an agent —
but almost all of them speak SNMP. Point `[snmp]` at one and its readings become
ordinary metrics, with the same thresholds, alerts and incidents as CPU or disk.

```ini
[snmp]
target    = 192.168.1.1     # host or host:port (default 161)
community = public          # v2c read community
timeout   = 3               # seconds per poll

# Every other key is a metric name = the OID to read.
uptime_ticks   = .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0          # sysUpTime
wan_in_octets  = .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.1     # ifInOctets on interface 1
wan_out_octets = .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.1     # ifOutOctets on interface 1
wan_oper       = .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.1      # ifOperStatus: 1 = up
```

**`snmp_up` is always reported — 1 or 0.** This is the important bit. A metric
that simply *stops arriving* does not alert: PylonMon skips a vital rule whose
metric is missing from a push. So if the device dies, its readings vanish and
nothing pages you. `snmp_up` turns that silence into a value you can alert on —
set a vital rule **`snmp_up < 1`** and you'll know.

Notes:

- **SNMPv2c only**, read-only, and the beacon only ever issues GETs — it can
  never write to your gear.
- The polling happens **on your LAN**, from the beacon. Nothing is exposed to
  the internet; only the results go out, over the same outbound push as
  everything else. That's the difference from every other SNMP tool, which
  wants to reach *into* your network.
- Non-numeric answers (device name, location) are ignored — they're not metrics.
- A missing OID is reported as *nothing*, never as `0`. A device that doesn't
  implement an OID shouldn't look like a genuine reading of zero.
- Enable SNMP on the device first. On UniFi that's
  **Settings → System → Advanced → SNMP** (availability varies by UniFi OS
  version). Vendor-specific OIDs live in that vendor's MIB; the standard
  MIB-II OIDs above work on essentially anything.

## Watching Proxmox: `[proxmox]`

On a hypervisor, the host is the least interesting half of the picture. It can
sit at 4% CPU with plenty of free memory while a VM has been off since Tuesday.
Add one section on the Proxmox host and the agent reports the *cluster's*
inventory alongside the host's own vitals:

```ini
[proxmox]
enabled = true
```

That's the whole configuration. The agent runs as root on the host, so it uses
the `pvesh` CLI that's already installed and already authenticated — no API
token to create, store, or rotate. It works the same on a standalone host as on
a cluster; Proxmox reports a single-node "cluster".

| Metric | What it is |
|---|---|
| `pve_qemu_running` / `_stopped` / `_total` | VMs |
| `pve_lxc_running` / `_stopped` / `_total` | LXC containers |
| `pve_guests_stopped` | every non-template guest that isn't running |
| `pve_nodes_online` / `_total` | cluster members |
| `pve_storage_pct` | the **fullest** storage, not an average |
| `pve_quorate` | `1` with quorum, `0` without (clusters only) |

Then a PylonMon vital rule does the judging — for example `pve_guests_stopped`
above `0` for 5 minutes, or `pve_storage_pct` above `85`. When guests are down,
the push also carries the *names* (`vm/102 db-01 on pve1`), so the alert tells
you what to go and start rather than just how many.

Notes:

- **Templates are never counted as stopped.** A template's status is `stopped`
  forever by definition; counting them would page every user who has one.
- **`pve_storage_pct` is the fullest pool**, deliberately. An average across one
  full pool and three empty ones hides the one that's about to break backups.
- Counters are reported at `0` when healthy, not omitted — a metric that only
  appears once something is wrong can't be graphed, and a threshold on a metric
  that's never been seen is never evaluated.
- If `pvesh` is missing, times out, or returns something unrecognisable, the
  integration reports **nothing** rather than zeros. "No data" and "everything
  is gone" must not look the same.
- `timeout` (seconds, default 8) and `bin` (path to `pvesh`) are available if
  you need them.

## Watching logs: `[logwatch]`

Some problems are a *rate*, not a state: a few Python tracebacks an hour is
life on the internet; forty in five minutes is an incident. Each `[logwatch]`
entry tails a file, counts regex matches inside a rolling window, and reports
the count as a normal metric — so a PylonMon vital rule with a sustained gate
does the judging. The latest matched block (a whole traceback, not just the
first line) rides along with the push, so a breach page can show you the
actual error.

```ini
# name = <file> | <regex, Go syntax, matched per line> | <window seconds>
[logwatch]
tracebacks_5m = /var/log/app/app.log | Traceback \(most recent call last\): | 300
oom_kills     = /var/log/kern.log    | Out of memory | 3600
http_500s     = /var/log/nginx/access.log | " 500 | 300
```

Then on the node monitor in PylonMon: `tracebacks_5m > 20 sustained 60s` →
the page arrives with the count *and* the most recent traceback.

Notes on `[logwatch]`:

- Reading is incremental — only what the file grew since the last push is
  scanned, capped at 4 MB per cycle so a log flood can't stall the beacon.
- On first start the watch begins at the **end** of the file: installing the
  beacon never pages you about last week's errors.
- Truncation and rotation are detected (file shrank) and the watch restarts
  from the top of the new file.
- Block capture is traceback-shaped: the matched line, its indented
  continuation lines, and the first non-indented line after them (the
  `SomeError: message` at the bottom), capped at 40 lines / 4 KB.
- The window defaults to 300s; minimum 15s. Name entries like metrics
  (`_5m`, `_1h` suffixes read well on the dashboard).

## Built-in collectors

| Metric        | Linux source              | Windows source            |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `cpu_pct`     | `/proc/stat` delta        | `GetSystemTimes` delta    |
| `mem_pct`     | `/proc/meminfo`           | `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`    |
| `disk_pct` (per mount) | `statfs`         | `GetDiskFreeSpaceEx`      |
| `load1`       | `/proc/loadavg`           | —                         |
| `temp_c`      | `/sys/class/thermal`      | — (add via `[custom]`)    |
| `uptime_s`    | `/proc/uptime`            | `GetTickCount64`          |

## What happens in PylonMon

- The first push **auto-creates a node monitor** named after the machine — a
  first-class **BEACON** monitor type. It counts as one monitor against your plan.
- Deadline = **1.5× your push interval** (minimum 30s), so the default 20s
  agent is flagged DOWN after ~30s of silence — alert channels, escalation
  ladders, and incidents all fire like any PylonMon monitor. Tune it per node
  in the monitor's edit form.
- The monitor's detail card shows the live **🗼 Node vitals** grid — with
  per-vital sparklines from recent pushes and daily min/avg/max trends kept
  for your plan's retention window.
- **Threshold rules**: on the node monitor you can set per-vital alerts
  (`disk_pct / > 90`, `temp_c > 75`, …) that page your channels the moment a
  push crosses the line — and send an all-clear when it recovers.
- Attach runbooks, labels, and SLOs like any other monitor.

## The wire format

The agent is a convenience, not a requirement. Anything that can POST JSON
over HTTPS can be a beacon:

```sh
curl -X POST https://pylonmon.com/api/ingest/exporter \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PYLON_KEY" \
  -d '{"node":"db01","interval":60,"metrics":{"cpu_pct":12.3,"mem_pct":44.1,"disk_pct":{"/":81},"temp_c":52}}'
```

`metrics` accepts numbers and one level of nesting (for per-mount disk and
the like). Up to 40 metrics per push.

`[logwatch]` entries add an optional top-level `samples` object —
`{"samples":{"tracebacks_5m":"Traceback (most recent call last):
…"}}` — with
the latest matched block per watch (≤4 KB each). Servers that predate samples
simply ignore the field.

## Service management

```sh
systemctl status pylon-beacon
journalctl -u pylon-beacon -f
```

Windows (PowerShell as admin):

```powershell
